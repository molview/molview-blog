I'm writing a draft for MolView 3.0 and I thought it would be awesome to collect
some screenshots from old MolView versions. I still didn't know about git (a
program to systematically keep track of your code) when I started building
MolView, so some of the old code is unrecoverable. I tried to restore some very
old versions from my old laptop and I actually got MolView v0.1 and v0.2 running
again for the first time in almost two years! MolView has changed a lot since
then and in this post I want to highlight some important developments from the
past two years.

Inspiration
-----------
You probably used one of these during your chemistry lessons: a [molecular model
kit]. By assembling the plastic parts, you could build all sorts of molecules.
We did this in my chemistry class a few years ago to help those who didn't yet
understand how molecular structures looked in three dimensions. It was a lot of
fun to finally use our knowledge about molecules to actually build them
(unfortunately the parts ran out pretty quickly).

At home I looked for a free, online program to build molecules but I couldn't
find many. However, I did find one particular program: the [Virtual Model Kit].
This program could be used to draw 2D molecules, convert them to 3D and a lot
more which I didn't really understand back then.

Turning 2D into 3D
------------------
I started doing some web development myself around that time and I decided that
I could make an even better, more visually appealing program. It took me quite
some time to find out how 2D structures could be resolved into 3D structures.
The secret turned out to be the [Chemical Identifier Resolver] which can turn 2D
coordinates into 3D coordinates. Unfortunately this service goes down for a
couple of days from time to time which is still causing malfunctions in MolView
2.4. For this reason, the Chemical Identifier Resolver will be replaced with a
program running on the MolView servers in MolView 3.

Bootstrap
---------
I made MolView available on *molview.tk* (a domain which was still free back
then), showed it to a couple of people and considered the project to be
finished. About a half year later I learned about [Bootstrap], a user interface
framework for websites built by Twitter. It looked quite stylish so I rewrote
the user interface of MolView using this toolkit.

More data
---------
Because of the redesign, MolView had gained my attention once again and I
implemented a search tool for [PubChem] (small molecules) and [RCSB] (proteins).
In the mean time the design got more complicated and Bootstrap was not really
suitable anymore so I developed a new, handwritten design to seamlessly fit all
features in one interface (for some reason black became the primary color).

A Top-Level Domain
------------------
The 1st of July 2014 is the day that *molview.org* was launched. This new domain
contained the first version of the 2.x series. One of the most exciting new
features in this version is the integration of the [Crystallography Open
Database] enabling users to view crystal structures. I also discovered git and
version control (keeping track of your code) around this time. MolView 2.1
(basically the same as v2.0) is the first version which is safely stored on
GitHub.

An autocomplete
---------------
I improved MolView a lot during the summer of 2014. MolView got a much whiter
design and an autocomplete feature to quickly find proteins, small molecules and
crystal structures. This is particularly useful for the crystal structures
because the Crystallography Open Database does not have a search index
(therefore searching it is relatively slow). The protein collection which you
can find via the autocomplete is derived from the [Molecular Machinery Poster]
from the Protein DataBank.

A new sketcher
--------------
The sketcher of MolView has changed twice. I first switched from a program
called Ketcher to a program called MolEdit because Ketcher caused conflicts with
some other parts of MolView. MolEdit is developed by [Molsoft] for academic and
personal use. I contacted Molsoft and initially they agreed that I was allowed
to use MolEdit as long as there was a link to their website. But just a few
weeks before the planned release of MolView 2.2 (12 November) I was contacted by
Molsoft and asked to put a Molsoft brand right on top of the sketcher. I didn't
quite agree with that (I don't want advertisement of any form in MolView!) and
decided to try the impossible; writing a molecule sketcher from scratch in only
a couple of weeks. Today MolView has, in my opinion, one of the best molecule
editors on the internet!

A new logo
----------
Recently a new logo for MolView was announced. You have probably read about it
in the [previous post](http://blog.molview.org/posts/2015/05/23/a-new-logo/).
