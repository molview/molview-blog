A while ago, I found out about the [Portable Native
Client](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client) (PNaCl, pronounced as
pinnacle). PNaCl is a sandboxing technology for running native machine code
directly in your browser. This means more CPU intensive processes like molecular
dynamics simulations can be executed inside MolView!

PNaCl could be the next big thing in MolView but it's not alone. There is [a
whole bunch](https://github.com/molview/molview/wiki/Roadmap) of things I want
to improve in future MolView versions. Unfortunately, the MolView core got more
messed up with each new set of features I added in the past year. Therefore I
have decided to entirely rethink the architecture and rewrite the codebase of
MolView.

I've started to work out a complete definition of how this version 3 core will
look like. The general idea is that MolView 3 will merely be a platform for
add-ons. It will only provide the basic needs for typical MolView features like
a menu, dialogs, a 3D viewer and of course the infamous find-everything search
entry ;-) Add-ons will be able to hook into these common elements so that I can
migrate all existing features to separate add-ons and other developers can
create their own add-ons that integrate perfectly with the MolView
look-and-feel!

Let me know about your ideas for MolView 3 below!
