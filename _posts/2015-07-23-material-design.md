summary:    MolView + Material Design = Awesome?
categories: posts

A while ago I shared a new design for MolView that was partially inspired by
Microsoft Office. In this post, I'm presenting another design that is based on
[Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).
Below is a comparison of the old mockup and the new mockup. You can slide the
splitter to see the difference. The new design is the one on the left, it takes
the best ideas from the right design and I believe it suits the purpose of
MolView 3 much better. It's simpler, more responsive and more colorful.

</div>

Search
-----
The search input is hard to miss, and that is a good thing because searching is
one of the primary features in MolView. When you focus the search input, it will
show a pop-up like in the picture below.

Guide
-----
A guide to explain tools to new users will be one of the most important new
features in MolView 3. This design shows a small panel at the bottom of the
application as shown in the picture below. This panel will tell you what to do
next. It will also automatically proceed to the next step.

Menus
-----
In this design I have tried to keep the menu's as simple and straightforward as
possible. The picture shows the main menu in the top-right corner and a view
menu for the sketcher. Each view (sketcher, 3D model, spectra viewer, etc.) will
have its own view menu containing some standard actions, for example to make
the view fullscreen or to embed the view content in your webpage.

Floating action button
----------------------
All features in MolView 3 will be packed in modules. A module can add a new
view. For example a Jmol viewer or a reaction pathway explorer. Extra modules,
such as third-party modules and optional/experimental features, can be added and
via the add-on manager. Some add-ons are run automatically in a certain context.
For example, a DNA sequence viewer might be activated when you load a protein.

Other add-ons, like a Jmol viewer, either have to be launched manually or
should be activated by default. The floating action button (big rounded button
on the top-right) in this design could be used as a shortcut to launch such
modules. However, I'm still unsure whether I will retain this button in the
final design.

Advanced search
---------------
A different application window is used to display multiple search results from
databases like PubChem. You can also access more advanced search tools via this
interface. And this interface will add more ways to dig through databases, such
as plain tables or graph representations (for a pathway database for example).

Edit the mockups yourself!
--------------------------
As an experiment, I created these mockups in Google Drawings instead of the
open-source program Inkscape, which I normally use. The files are publicly
accessible. If you have a Google account you can easily copy one and try out a
different color, or even add your own buttons to the toolbar! To copy a drawing
to your Google Drive, go to one of the links below and click **File > Make a copy**.
