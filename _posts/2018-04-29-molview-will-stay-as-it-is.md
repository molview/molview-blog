I have been wanting to write this for a while, and today I finally got to it.
In a previous post on this blog, which was written a little under a year ago,
I wrote about my ambitious plans to develop new features for MolView. I also
wanted to develop it from scratch, because in the meantime my programming style
had radically changed, and I had much better ideas about how to write software.
But since there also were (and still are) other projects I wanted to spend my
free time on, I promised myself I would only invest more time in MolView if it
turned out popular enough to collect a decent amount of donations. This would be
not only to make up for the invested time, but also cover service costs and
allow investment in additional services (such as web-servers to perform relevant
calculations).

I decided to setup an account on Bountysource where users could contribute a
monthly or one-time amount, and also vote for new features or issues that have
to be resolved: [https://www.bountysource.com/teams/molview][1]. I linked to
this page from the loading popup on molview.org. So far five people have donated
a total of 100$ (if you donated and are reading this, thank you very much, I
appreciate your support!). This is enough to keep MolView online for roughly two
years, but not enough for other endeavors.

I think it is time to face the fact that MolView is good enough as it is. Based
on recent estimates there are about .6 million users a year, which is something
that definitely makes me proud! But right now there is simply not enough
traction to support further development. I do not have time to push this more,
and despite the fact that some features are repeatedly requested, I think the
vast majority of MolView users is already covered by the current feature set.

New features I personally found very interesting include a more sophisticated
integration of MolView into other websites, and providing MolView in other
languages such as Spanish, French and Chinese.

## The bottom line

I more or less officially announce that MolView will stay as it is right now,
and that at this time no plans exist to change it. I will keep doing my best to
answer support emails, and keep MolView online and accessible for free. I have
no plans to ever add advertising to MolView.org.

## Patreon page

I also moved the main page for financial support to Patreon. I made this
decision primarily because Patreon is much more well known than Bountysource.
You can find the new page here: [https://www.patreon.com/molview][2]. If you
believe MolView is useful, and are in the position to donate a small monthly
amount, please consider doing so!
